Subject: Request for Mess Rebate Due to Delay in Tender Change

Dear [Respected Authorities' Names],

I hope this email finds you in good health. I am writing as a concerned resident of the boys' hostel at [Hostel Name], to bring to your attention a matter of considerable concern regarding the mess facilities. As per the directives issued by the authorities, the tender for the hostel mess was supposed to be changed at the beginning of this semester, and yet, it has not been implemented even after two months.

I understand that administrative processes can sometimes face delays; however, the prolonged delay in changing the mess tender has led to several inconveniences for the students residing in the hostel. The mess services are a crucial part of our daily lives, and the delay in implementing the changes has resulted in subpar meal quality and inconsistency in the menu. This not only affects our physical well-being but also creates a sense of dissatisfaction and frustration among the residents.

Moreover, we have been paying the full mess charges as per the existing tender, despite not receiving the promised services. This situation is not only unfair to us but also puts an additional financial burden on the students.

In light of the above, I kindly request that the authorities take immediate action to rectify this situation. It would be greatly appreciated if the mess tender could be changed as soon as possible to ensure that the students receive the quality of service they deserve. Additionally, I would like to request a rebate for the extra charges we have paid during this period when the promised changes were not implemented.

I understand that unforeseen circumstances can lead to delays, but I believe it is the responsibility of the administration to ensure that students receive the services they are entitled to in a timely manner.

I kindly request a prompt response to this matter, indicating the steps that will be taken to address the situation and provide a resolution. If necessary, I would be willing to participate in discussions or meetings to help expedite this process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I hope for a swift and positive resolution to the issues mentioned above.

Sincerely,
